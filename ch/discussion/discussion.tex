\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}
In this chapter the discussion about the final status of the project, as well as future work or improvements, is presented.
Following the structure of the report this is divided in two parts: (1) the mobile robot and (2) the robot workcell.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Have better space awareness, perhaps, two LIDARS.
		\item Improve runtime. Better batteries, reduce the power consumption.
		\item Improve reliability of the tipper. Perhaps improving the materials and the building quality of the assembly.
		\item Use global shutter cameras so the motion blur can be reduced.
		\item Improve mechanical implementation of the robot to increase robustness and reliability of the robot.
		\item Improve free navigation. Having several local path planner for the different purposes in the free navigation. Having the camera localization inside the box will help too.
	\end{itemize}
