\section{Task Breakdown Table \label{sec:tasks}}
%%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A “who worked with what” table listing the project task broken into relevant subtasks to the left of the table and all students of the group above the table. For each subtask is listed how many percent of this task that was accomplished by each student.

Maybe it is a better idea to put it in the appendix and just reference the table from the SCRUM section.
