The goal of the project was the development of a robot production facility that packs LEGO orders for a company. The LEGO orders describe a number of particular bricks in different colors and shapes, which are to be selected and packed for delivery. 

The system consists of the following elements, performing the tasks listed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Manufacturing Execution System (MES): The central server managing order processing and scheduling. 
	\item Robot cells: Sorting and packing the LEGO bricks. 
	\item Mobile robots: Transporting unsorted as well as sorted and packed LEGO bricks. 
	\item LEGO brick dispenser: Supplying the LEGO bricks. 
	\item MarkerLocator: Positioning system for tracking the mobile robots. 
	\item Safety System (Pilz Safety Eye): Accident prevention.
\end{itemize}

The connection of these system elements is shown in figure \ref{fig:overall_system_diagram}.
