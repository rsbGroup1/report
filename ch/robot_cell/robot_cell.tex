\chapter{Robot Cell Design}\label{chap:robot_cell_chapter}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equipped with a robot manipulator, a gripper and a conveyor belt the task of the robot cell is to sort the LEGO bricks delivered by the mobile robot. These are dropped onto the conveyor belt which moves them closer to the camera and robot. Here the corresponding bricks ordered by the MES system should be picked and returned to the mobile robot. This is the task each robot cell has to fulfil, and just like in the case of the mobile platform, the process can be subdivided into smaller tasks, which we will introduce in the upcoming sections.
