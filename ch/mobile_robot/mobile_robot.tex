The mobile platform performed the task of transporting the LEGO bricks between the dispenser unit, and the robot cell. It had to be able to fulfill this task in a completely autonomous manner under normal operation, avoid collision with obstacles, be harmless to its operators and be remotely controllable through a human machine interface. It was also a requirement that its progress should be monitored through the aforementioned user interface. 

Due to the high complexity of the task, we decided to pursue a modular approach. In this chapter we will introduce the components comprising the system, the motivation for having them, their implementation and the reasons behind the choices we made during the design process.
