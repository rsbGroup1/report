Building reliable robot systems is essential to industrial applications, but can pose significant challenges due to the numerous components involved. The system as a whole and all its components have to be remotely controllable in a user friendly way, capable of fulfilling the tasks they were meant to do in a fast and efficient manner, incorporate safety mechanisms to reduce hazard of damage both to the system and the operator(s), while being robust enough to recover from non-fatal errors which might occur during operation. In this repost we will present the concept and implementation details of such a system, capable of processing orders issued by a central server unit and acting upon it by retrieving, delivering, sorting and packing LEGO bricks autonomously.
