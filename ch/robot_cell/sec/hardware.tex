The following hardware elements was provided in each robot cell:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Kuka KR6 Robot
	\item PG70 Gripper
	\item Conveyor Belt with 3 phase 240V Motor
	\item ABB (ACS150-01E) Frequency Converter
	\item ABB (PM554) Programmable Logic Controller(PLC) for conveyor control
	\item SICK (M4000) Laser safety fence
	\item HD Webcam for Lego brick detection in 2D
	\item Kuka touch screen for HMI
	
\end{itemize}

The setup for involved components will be discussed in details where 
appropriate. 

\subsection{Modifications}
The conveyor belt required some changes to be able to handle and control the 
flow of Lego bricks. First a funnel(see figure \ref{fig:funnel}) was added as a 
tip-off 
location for the mobile robot.

\end{figure}. Secondly, to avoid clustering and 
multiple layers of bricks a passive system consisting of a brush and cardboard 
was invented (Shown in figure \ref{fig:brush}).

\end{figure} To provide the necessary friction to 
go through the system, duct tape was added at random places to the conveyor 
belt. See figure\ref{fig:duct_tape}.

\end{figure} Finally, to avoid unwanted bricks on the 
floor, a passive slider was mounted near end of the conveyor belt. This allows 
the bricks to fall into a well placed box and collected at a later 
time. See figure\ref{fig:slider}
